c       Track-length neutron heating estimate.
c       Note that the tabular region should agree with f26:n, but
c       that the high-energy region is nonsense, since the heating
c       numbers at the top of the table continue to be used for all
c       energies above the table.  Note also that the segment divisor
c       is the mass of the cell, replacing the cell volume that would
c       by default have been used for the normalization.
c       This shows how to convert MeV/cm**3 to MeV/gram for f4 tallies.
