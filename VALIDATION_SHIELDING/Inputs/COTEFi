tld Co-60 benchmark problem:  teflon
c         this file uses mcnp to model the hupmobile thermo-
c     luminescent dosimeter radiation experiment.  this experi-
c     ment consisted of a point radiation source and a teflon cylin-
c     der 1 ft long with 17 lif tlds imbedded along its axis at spec-
c     ified intervals.  the point source was located 1 meter from one
c     edge of the cylinder along its axis.
c         the teflon cylinder has steel walls 1/4 inch thick and was
c     divided into cells that were disks along its axis and rings con-
c     centric with these disks.  the cells were 2.54 cm thick along
c     the axis--this is approximately 1 mfp of gammas in teflon.  a
c     ten-meter sphere centered at the center of the cylinder formed
c     the boundary of the problem.
