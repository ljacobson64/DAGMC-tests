gamma  ray skyshine experiment  d hollowell 3/90
c
c     this mcnp file is an attempt to recreate the gamma
c      ray skyshine experiment of Nason, Shultis, Faw and
c      Clifford, Nuc. Sci. & Engineering 79 (1981), p 404.
c      this input deck should model an approximately 150
c      degree upward cone gamma ray source, from cobalt 60.  
c      we measure the dose at 100 m intervals from the source,
c      out to 700 m, and we measure it at 50 m.  we use
c      ring detectors for this measurement.
c     the majority of effort in setting up this problem is
c      getting a good geometry to give good weight to the
c      detected photons.
c     
c     the region directly illuminated by the source is
c      divided into concentric spheres.  the region above 
c      the ground indirectly illuminated is divided into
c      a set of nestled cones, all with ~ 150 degree 
c      opening.  the ground is divided into three layers.

c
c     Note that MCNP will give flux as 1/cm**2, per source particle.
c     To change this to a dose we use the flux multiplier card "FM".
c     For a given # tally, the fm card fm#   rho  m  -5 -6" will
c     produce a tally with dose units MeV/cm**3.   In this card "rho"
c     is the number density (#/(cm*barn)) of the absorbing particles
c     and "m" is the material number of the absorbing particles.  The
c     -5 and -6 specify to include (respectively) the interaction
c     cross section and the heating fraction.  This "fm" card provides
c     results in MeV/cm**3 per history, and we want, for instance,
c     [rad/history].  Since 1 rad = 100 erg/g  ,  we can convert the
c     number produced by this "fm" card to [rad/history] by multiplying
c     the tally result by
c     {[1.602e-6(erg/MeV)] * [1(rad)/100(erg/g))] /
c                                [mass density (g/cm**3)]}
c     which is 1.43e-05 if the density is .0011 g/cm**3 ... this
c     multiplicative factor takes Mev/cm**3/history to rad/history.
c     In the case of Nason Shultis and Faw, they wanted an answer in
c     microrad/hour/Ci (where Ci is source strength in curies).  For a
c     666 Ci source, then, to convert from rad/history to microrad/hr/Ci
c     we multiply further, by a factor:
c     { [3.7e+10((history/sec)/(Ci))] * [666(Ci)] * [3600(sec/hr)] *
c                       [1.e+06(microrad/rad)] }  /  [666(Ci)]
c     which is 1.332e+20 ... this converts rad/history to microrad/
c     hr/Ci.    We multiply these two factors together to get the
c     multiplicative factor that converts the "fm" card's MeV/cm**3
c     to microrad/hr/Ci,  this final multiplicative factor is 1.905e+15
