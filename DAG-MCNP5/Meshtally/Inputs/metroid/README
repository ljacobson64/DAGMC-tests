Metroid (5 sphere) test

* metroid_mcnp.inp : native MCNP geometry for this test problem.  
* geom_metroid.sat : output of running mcnp2cad on metroid_mcnp.inp.  All 
  mesh files are based on this geometry.
* meshall.cub : All volumes tetmeshed in CUBIT
* vol2345.h5m : Volumes 2-5 (the inner spheres) from meshall.cub
* geom_metroid.h5m : Combined geometry file from dagmc_preproc.  
  Surfaces for volumes 2-6 are taken from meshall.cub, while the other
  surfaces are taken from geom.sat.  (Faceting tolerance won't matter
  because all surfaces not taken from CUBIT are planar.)
* metroid.inp : DAG-MCNP5 input file for running this problem

When vol2345.cub is used as a tally mesh and geom23456.h5m is 
used as the problem geometry, then this represents a test of a fully
conformal mesh tally.

The name of this test is given based on its resemblance to the eponymous 
space critter in the Metroid games.  It has a storied history: as of its
initial commit it has unearthed a bug in CUBIT, a misuse of tag storage 
specifiers in MOAB, and a bug in the dagmc mesh tally code.
